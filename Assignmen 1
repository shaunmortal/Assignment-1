#  Basic If-Else Problems:
===========================

1. Write a program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd.
3. Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year or not.
4. Write a program to find the greatest of two numbers.
5. Write a program to check whether a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18).
6. Write a program to check whether a given character is a vowel or consonant.
7. Write a program to check if a number is divisible by 5.
8. Write a program to determine whether a given number is a single-digit, two-digit, or more than two-digit
number.
9. Write a program to check whether a student has passed or failed (passing marks = 40).
10. Write a program to find whether the entered number is a multiple of both 3 and 7.


Ladder If & Nested If:
=======================
1. Write a program to find the greatest among three numbers.
2. Write a program to classify a person based on age: Child (<13), Teenager (13-19), Adult (20-59), Senior (60+).
3. Write a program to assign grades based on marks:

90-100: A,
75-89: B,
50-74: C,
35-49: D,
<35: Fail.

4. Write a program to check the type of triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene) based on sides.
5. Write a program to check if a character is uppercase, lowercase, digit, or special symbol.
6. Write a program to calculate electricity bill based on units:

Up to 100 units: ₹5 per unit,
101–200 units: ₹7 per unit,
Above 200 units: ₹10 per unit.
7. Write a program to determine the largest of four numbers using nested if.
8. Write a program to check if a given year is a century year and also a leap year.

Obese (30+).
10. Write a program to display the smallest number using nested if.


For Loop Problems:
===================
1. Write a program using a for loop to print all Armstrong numbers between 100 and 999. (Armstrong number:
sum of cubes of digits equals the number itself. Example: 153 => 13+53+33 = 153).
2. Write a program to generate and display the first n prime numbers using a for loop.
3. Write a program to display all numbers from 1 to 500 that are divisible by 3, but the sum of their digits
should not exceed 10.
4. Write a program using a for loop to print a pyramid of stars (*) of height n. Example for n=4:

*
***
*****
*******

5. Write a program to accept a string and check whether it is a pangram (contains all 26 alphabets at least once)
using a for loop.
6. Write a program using a for loop to print all twin primes between 1 and 100. (Twin primes: pairs of prime
numbers with a difference of 2, e.g., (3,5), (11,13)).
7. Write a program that accepts a number from the user and prints whether it is a Harshad number (number
divisible by the sum of its digits) using a for loop.

9. Write a program using a for loop to display the sum of the series:
12 + 22 + 32 + ... + n2
10. Write a program that accepts a number from the user and prints whether it is a Strong number (sum of
factorials of digits = number itself) using a for loop. Example: 145 => 1! + 4! + 5! = 145.

# While Loop Problems:
========================                                        
11. Write a program using a while loop to find the reverse of a number and check if the reversed number is
prime. Example: Input = 73 → Reverse = 37 → Prime.
12. Write a program that continues to accept numbers from the user until the sum of digits of all numbers
entered becomes greater than 100.
13. Write a program using a while loop to check whether a number is a Duck number (a number containing zero
but not starting with zero, e.g., 202, 1203).
14. Write a program using a while loop to accept a number and check if it is a Happy number. (A number is
happy if repeatedly replacing it with the sum of squares of its digits eventually reaches 1). Example: 19 is a
happy number.
15. Write a program using a while loop to find the largest prime factor of a given number.
16. Write a program to repeatedly accept a string from the user until the string entered is a palindrome.
17. Write a program using a while loop to compute the sum of digits of a number until the result becomes a
single-digit number (Digital root). Example: 9875 => 9+8+7+5=29 => 2+9=11 => 1+1=2.
18. Write a program using a while loop to generate the Collatz sequence for a given number. (Rule: If n is even
=> n/2, if odd => 3n+1. Continue until n=1).
19. Write a program using a while loop to accept a number and check whether it is a Kaprekar number.
(Kaprekar number: if square of the number can be split into two parts whose sum equals the number.
Example: 452=2025 => 20+25=45).
20. Write a program to simulate an ATM machine using a while loop where a user can:
• Check balance
• Deposit money
• Withdraw money (only if balance is sufficient)
• Exit
Continue until the user chooses to exit.

For Loop Problems:
===================
1. Write a program using a for loop to print all Armstrong numbers between 100 and 999. (Armstrong number:
sum of cubes of digits equals the number itself. Example: 153 => 13+53+33 = 153).
2. Write a program to generate and display the first n prime numbers using a for loop.
3. Write a program to display all numbers from 1 to 500 that are divisible by 3, but the sum of their digits
should not exceed 10.
4. Write a program using a for loop to print a pyramid of stars (*) of height n. Example for n=4:

*
***
*****
*******

5. Write a program to accept a string and check whether it is a pangram (contains all 26 alphabets at least once)
using a for loop.
6. Write a program using a for loop to print all twin primes between 1 and 100. (Twin primes: pairs of prime
numbers with a difference of 2, e.g., (3,5), (11,13)).
7. Write a program that accepts a number from the user and prints whether it is a Harshad number (number
divisible by the sum of its digits) using a for loop.
8. Write a program to generate Pascal’s Triangle up to n rows using a for loop.
9. Write a program using a for loop to display the sum of the series:
12 + 22 + 32 + ... + n2
10. Write a program that accepts a number from the user and prints whether it is a Strong number (sum of
factorials of digits = number itself) using a for loop. Example: 145 => 1! + 4! + 5! = 145.
